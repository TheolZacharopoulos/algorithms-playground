"""
You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds of nodes.
Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.

Solution:
The treeMatch procedure visits each node in the small tree at most once and
is called no more than once per node of the large tree.
Worst case runtime is at most O(n * m), where n and m are the sizes of trees T1 and T2, respectively.
If k is the number of occurrences of T2â€™s root in T1, the worst case runtime can be characterized as O(n + k * m).
