"""
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
DEFINITION:
Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an earlier node,
so as to make a loop in the linked list.

EXAMPLE:
Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier] Output: C
